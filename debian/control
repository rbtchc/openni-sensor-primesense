Description: headers for working with PrimeSense sensor OpenNI modules
 OpenNI is a framework for getting data to support 'Natural Interaction',
 i.e. skeleton tracking, gesture tracking, and similar ways of getting data
 from humans. This package provides modules for OpenNI that get the data from
 the PrimeSense camera for processing with the OpenNI Middleware, like
 PrimeSense NITE.
 .
 This package provides the headers for building against these sensor modules.
